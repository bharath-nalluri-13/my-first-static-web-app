            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Climate change is impacting human health. An obvious effect of a
              warmer environment is more frequent and severe heat waves.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact on Cardiovascular Health</h2>
            <p>
              During the European heat wave of 2003, there were an estimated
              35,000 more deaths than normal in the first two weeks of August.
              Many of the deaths resulted from cardiovascular complications
              among the elderly. As heat waves become more commonplace in the
              future, so will the number of heat strokes and the onset of other
              cardiovascular problems. Higher summertime temperatures also
              increase tropospheric ozone concentrations which in turn affects
              people with asthma and causes lung and heart damage. Increases in
              the levels of photochemical pollutants like ozone are associated
              with a warming world.
            </p>

            <h2>Impact on Vector-Borne Diseases</h2>
            <p>
              Habitat modification also results from climate change and alters
              the regional prevalence of certain vector-borne diseases. A warmer
              environment and the accompanying incidence of extreme weather
              events will continue to affect the strength and distribution of
              certain diseases that favor standing water. The history of
              humankind both past and present has shown us that heat waves and
              cold spells as well as floods and droughts are often accompanied
              by disease outbreaks. Respiratory infections and other diseases
              run rampant when people are forced into crowded shelters due to
              tropical storms or flooding. In the aftermath of extreme weather
              events, conditions tend to favor many of the insects, bacteria,
              viruses and protozoa that spread disease. Higher temperatures and
              rainfall amounts affect the life cycles of disease carrying
              insects such as mosquitoes and ticks. Changes in weather affect
              contagious diseases such as influenza and pneumonia, as well as
              allergic diseases such as asthma while higher levels of humidity
              increase the incidence and severity of fungal infections and
              infestations.

            <h2>Examples of Mosquito-Borne Diseases</h2>
            <p>
              For example, while West Nile encephalitis virus is not new, it
              recently caught the attention of health officials in the United
              States. First appearing in New York during the summer of 1999,
              West Nile killed seven citizens. The symptoms of this disease
              range from muscle weakness and mental confusion to brain damage
              and death. For most victims, however, the effects are mild and
              include headaches, swollen glands, rash, and aching muscles
              resembling the symptoms that accompany the flu. West Nile
              encephalitis is spread by birds that have been infected by
              mosquitoes carrying the virus. The first documentation of infected
              birds in the U.S. took place in Georgia and the Carolinas. By
              2001, as many as twenty states east of the Mississippi River had
              detected the diseased birds. While less than one percent of
              mosquitoes carry the virus, those that can live from one summer to
              the next as a result of warmer winters are the cause for the
              continuity of the disease from year to year.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 1990s, dengue fever appeared in South America and has
              grown to pandemic proportions with most cases appearing in the
              Caribbean and India. This viral infection is spread by mosquitoes
              with symptoms that include severe muscle aches and pain in the
              bones accompanied by a rash. A typical case lasts for a few weeks.
              However, dengue hemorrhagic fever is a severe form of the virus
              that can cause internal bleeding eventually leading to death.
              Crowded urban areas are more susceptible to outbreaks of dengue
              fever. In 1993 and 1994, there were epidemics of the disease along
              the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. Later during the unusually warm
              summer of 1995, the range of the disease carrying mosquitoes
              expanded across the mountains of Costa Rica to invade the rest of
              the country as well as other parts of Central America and South
              America. It is estimated that approximately 150,000 people were
              infected with the virus and thousands of those died due to
              hemorrhaging. One of the worst outbreaks on record occurred in
              2007 throughout the Caribbean affecting hundreds of thousands of
              inhabitants and killing at least 200 individuals. As these regions
              are exposed to higher rainfall totals as a result of climate
              change, more pools of stagnant water along roadside ditches and in
              open containers contribute to a rise in the number of mosquitoes
              that carry the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another relatively new mosquito-borne viral fever is Chikungunya.
              The symptoms of this viral infection include a sudden high fever,
              severe headache, and a variety of skin rashes which continue for a
              week or more. This condition can be accompanied by arthritis-like
              pain in the bones and joints which persist for weeks or months.
              The high fever usually lasts a couple of days before finally
              breaking. Chikungunya and dengue fever are spread by the Aedes
              albopictus and the Aedes aegypti mosquito, both of which are
              predominant in the warm, moist regions of the southern United
              States. According to the Center for Disease Control, approximately
              30 cases of Chikungunya have been reported in the U.S. among
              persons who recently traveled to parts of Asia that had
              experienced outbreaks of the fever. Chikungunya first appeared in
              1952 along the border of Tanganyika and Mozambique in east Africa,
              and by 1999 it had spread to Malaysia. Thousands of cases were
              reported in southern India during the fall of 2004, and the virus
              has since infected more than one million individuals across that
              country along with another 300,000 on the islands of the Indian
              Ocean. There is no effective means of curing the virus other than
              time, and the only preventive treatment is mosquito netting and
              pesticide. If climate change enhances the monsoonal rains in this
              region of the world, health officials fear an increase in
              outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases which could likely swamp
              local hospitals and clinics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most widespread mosquito-borne disease is malaria. The
              symptoms consist of headache, weakness, anemia, fever, chills, and
              intestinal pain. Most victims of malaria survive, but they live
              with chronic pain. The parasite transmitted by the mosquito may
              lie dormant in the host and not become active for weeks or months.
              Once infected, a person may build immunity to the disease.
              However, in most cases there is the potential of being re-infected
              multiple times. Additionally, the disease can be transmitted by
              blood transfusions. There are more cases of malaria today than
              ever before in human history. The disease has been documented in
              more than 100 countries
            </p>

            <h2>Addendum: HTML Structure Explanation</h2>
            <p>
              In this HTML document, I have structured the content of the
              research paper titled "The Impact of Climate Change on Human
              Health" by Mary Snow and Rich Snow. Please find the explanation of
              the chosen HTML tags with reasoning:
            </p>

            <h3>Head Section:</h3>
            <p>
              - The &lt;head&gt; section has the metadata about the document,
              which includes the character set and viewport settings. It also
              includes the title of the document.
            </p>

            <h3>Body Section:</h3>
            <p>
              - The &lt;body&gt; section is the main content area of the
              document where the paper's content is presented. Note that the
              paper itself did not have the sections indivually written. After
              reading the paper, with my understanding, I created those sections
              for better readability.
            </p>

            <h3>Heading Tags:</h3>
            <p>
              - I have used &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;h3&gt; tags to
              structure the content into sections and subsections, making it
              more readable and organized for the readers that are not much
              familiar with the research paper readings. This follows the
              hierarchical structure of the paper.
            </p>

            <h3>Paragraphs and Strong Tags:</h3>
            <p>
              - &lt;p&gt; tags are used for paragraphs, providing separation and
              readability for the content. - &lt;strong&gt; tags are used to
              focus important information, such as author names and section
              headings.
            </p>

            <h3>Hyperlinks:</h3>
            <p>
              - I used &lt;a&gt; tags to create hyperlinks. These links provide
              easy access to external resources like the DOI (Digital Object
              Identifier) and email addresses.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>
              - The HTML structure provided gives us a well-organized and
              accessible presentation of the research paper's content. This is
              one of the best practices in structuring academic documents on the
